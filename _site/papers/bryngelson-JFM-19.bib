Abstract      = {The impact of a collapsing gas bubble above rigid, notched walls is
considered. Such surface crevices and imperfections often function as bubble
nucleation sites, and thus have a direct relation to cavitation-induced erosion
and damage structures. A generic configuration is investigated numerically
using a second-order-accurate compressible multi-component flow solver in a
two-dimensional axisymmetric coordinate system. Results show that the crevice
geometry has a significant effect on the collapse dynamics, jet formation,
subsequent wave dynamics, and interactions. The wall-pressure distribution
associated with erosion potential is a direct consequence of development and
intensity of these flow phenomena.},
