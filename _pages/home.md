# Welcome!

#### `$whoami`

New biomedical devices and therapies stand to improve human health outcomes the world over.
Though innovating in this space is challenging, predictive simulation tools provide a promising path forward.
I am a computational scientist who clears these paths via new data-driven models, numerical algorithms, and extreme-scale software.
Recent examples include the [most efficient sub-grid model]({{ site.url }}{ site.baseurl }}/papers/bryngelson-IJMF-20.pdf) for simulating cavitation, a [very-low-order model]({{ site.url }}{ site.baseurl }}/papers/bryngelson-PRE-19.pdf) for cell-scale blood flow, and [MFC](https://mfc-caltech.github.io/), my scalable open-source multi-phase flow solver.
These developments guide biomicrofluidic device design and improve human patient outcomes for a range of medical treatments (e.g. burst-wave [lithotripsy](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/lithotripsy)).

#### `$id`

I am currently a Senior Postdoctoral Scholar at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/), working with Professor Tim Colonius.
I also work with Professor Themis Sapsis at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on machine-learned model closures.
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Center for Exascale Simulation of Plasma-Coupled Combustion (XPACC).
I have a Ph.D. and M.S. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (2017 and 2015), where I worked with Professor Jonathan Freund.
I hold B.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Mathematics from the University of Michigan–Dearborn (2013).
