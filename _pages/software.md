  <h4>Multicomponent Flow Code (MFC)</h4>
MFC is a fully-documented open source parallel simulation software for multi-component, multi-phase, and bubbly flows. 
It is capable of efficiently solving a wide range of flows, including droplet atomization, shock–
bubble interaction, and gas bubble cavitation. 
It includes the 5- and 6-equation thermodynamically-consistent diffuse-interface models to handle such flows, which are coupled to high-order
interface-capturing methods, HLL-type Riemann solvers, and TVD time-integration schemes that are
capable of simulating unsteady flows with strong shocks. The numerical methods are implemented in
a flexible, modular framework that is amenable to future development. The methods are
validated via comparisons to experimental results for shock–bubble, shock–droplet, and shock–watercylinder interaction problems and verified to be free of spurious oscillations for material-interface
advection and gas–liquid Riemann problems. For smooth solutions, such as the advection of an
isentropic vortex, the methods are verified to be high-order accurate.
