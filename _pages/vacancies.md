## Group openings

**We are always open to the possibility of new group members.**

In the ACME Group, you will work on cutting-edge computational materials science for a variety of energy applications crucial to our carbon-free future. You will build materials science and software engineering skills, and (hopefully!) strong friendships along the way. Read more about our group's values and expectations [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/values).

If you are interested in working with us, please send Rachel an [email](mailto:{{site.email}}). 
State briefly why you are interested and attach your CV. Also mention your favorite cartoon character.
There is no need for a separate cover letter.
